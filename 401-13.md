## Repository Design ##

- Repositories are classes that aid in accessing data and remove that functionality as something in the domain layer which must be upkept by the programmer.
- When using repositories make sure that they are the only thing changing the data at their source, otherwise when the repository pulls information down from the database to memory and modifies it a disconnect can happen where something else modifies the database before the information in memory is put back, creating inconsistencies.
- You should only have one repository for each aggregate root for similar reasons, if multiple things can access the database then it is not gauranteed that there will not be overlapping access attempts creating discrepencies.




## SOLID Principles ##

- S: Single Responsibility Principle
  - Every method or class in your code should have one and exactly one task. 
  - This makes testing easier as there should only be one variable to compare against.
- O: the Open/Close Principle
  - Method and classes should be open to extension but closed to modification. 
  - This can be done by inheritance and other such methods, but modifying the base behavior which is designed to work for gerneric cases can introduce instability into your code.
- L: The Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Not the name of the person who created the SOLID principles so good on him for that
  - An object in your application should be able to be replaced by a type derived from it without breaking everything. Make sure that your inheritance is backwards compatible.
- I: The Interface Sgragation Principle
  - Interfaces should be designed to only deal with the discrete needs of the user and not bloat to giant all encompassing things.
  - Small targeted things are easier to test and run better in code.
- D: The Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Depend on abstractions and not on concretions. This gives you the ability to modify what you are working with
