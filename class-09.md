# *Forms and JS Events*

**Forms**

[Forms Cheat Sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-forms/cheatsheet)

- Forms are a way for the user to input data that you can then parse and store.
- Form elements always require an action
- Forms can take in inputs in different ways, check the cheat sheet for a concise summary.
- Each form control should have it's own label associated with it.
- You can add validation to your forms to help guide the user to entering correct information. This allows you to have more conifence in the information passed in.

**Table Formatting**

[Tables cheat sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-tables/cheatsheet)
- You can change the style of lists to change the bulletpoints/numbers that appear. Outside and inside properties can be added to control whether the markers appear inside the element box.
- Tables can be modified down to the individual cell with enough targeting. THings like background color, border, spacing between cells, and font size can all be modified.

**JS Events**

[JS Events Cheat Sheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/build-interactive-websites/modules/dom-javascript-events/cheatsheet)

- Events are triggers that can happen on a webpage which it can use to trigger code. They range from having a user hover over a specific item to having document nodes added.
- It is best practice not to have events trigger from HTML in order to maintain the seperation of concerns. It may be something that older code has though so be aware that it is possible.
- DOM event handlers are more embedded in the code, and each event handler can only have 1 function attached to it.
- Event listeners can deal with more than one function at a time by involving logic checks, but older browsers might not support them.
- There are like a lot of problems if trying to make this for older browsers.
- Events handlers can be on multiple elements in a page, by default the browser will search for more specific elements rather than parents but this can be reversed.
