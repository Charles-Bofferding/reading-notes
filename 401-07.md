# *[Interfaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface)*

## Basics ##

- Interfaces are groups of related functionalities that non abstract calsses or structs must implement
- Static methods must have an implementation
- Interface can not set up properties with default values. It in fact can not even be instantiated.
- Interfaces can define Methods, Properties, Indexers, and Events. They usually don't have a body.
  - After c# 8.0 body code was allowed in interfaces, this mens that they now can include everything before pluss Constants, Operators, Static Cunstroctors, and Nested Types.


## The Why of Interfaces ##

- Interfaces aer used to seperate the implementation of something from the functionality of it.
- Interfaces should always be used across multiple classes according to this article and you are dumb if you don't.
