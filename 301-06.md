**Node**

**Pair Programming**
- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  - Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from peers, developing social skills, preparing for job interviews, and preparing for the work environment.
- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - I have found the engaged collaboration to be most beneficial. Getting someone to sit down with you to have that instant feedback of your ideas to theirs and vice versa without the lag of doing a day's work before realizing that your part won't properly interface with one from someone else.
- How does pair programming work?
  - There is a driver and a navigator. The driver is doing the actual coding and things like that while the navigator looks more at the big picture and tries to keep an eye on things the driver might be to focused in to see.
