# *Introduction to React and Components*

**Component Based Architecture**
- What is a component? 
  -  A software object designed to fill a particular and defined role. It does not need to solve the entire problem but through it\'s modularity it can be re-used in different applications.
- What are the characteristics of a component?
  - Components are re-usable, replaceable, extendable, independent, and encapsulated.
- What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
  - The ease of deployment because of the modularity, the independence of that part of the code, the reusable nature of the component, and the ease of system maintenance are all advantages of component based architecture.


**Component Based Architecture**

- What is props short for?
  - Props stands for properties in react. W3 school says that Props are arguments passed into React components.
- How are props used in React?
  - Props are used to pass information to a component, like you would use a function argument. It is a uni-directional low of data, and the data can only be read and not modified in a way that other components will see unless you get complicated.
- What is the flow of props?
  - The flow of Props is uni-directional which means that the information goes from the parent to the child and not the other way.
