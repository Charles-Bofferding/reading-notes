# *Github and Revision Control*

## VCS: Version Control System
	- Allows developers to work on code at the same time
	- Keeps a history of all commits sent to the system
	- Helps keep all project files in one repository
    - The **Head** of a branch is the most recent commit to the repository

The most important sequqnce when pushing back to the server is A C P. Below I have listed the command line codes and underneath that what they do.
1. A: git add name_of_file
    - Tells git what to get ready to load
1. C: git commit -m "some message"
    - Create a message for your commit and get everything ready to go
1. P: git push origin main
    - Perform the actual push to the server.
