# *Linked Lists*
- [Microsoft Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1?view=net-5.0)

## Basics ##

- Collection of nodes that have a value and a link to another node(s)
- Singly: one directional links between nodes
- Doubly: links to both forawrd and backward nodes.
- Head: the first item in the linked list
- Current: Node being looked at
- Linked lists are a linear data structure
- Linked lists do not need to be in order in memory
- Linked lists can be expanded, while arrays can not (in c#)

## Usage ##

- You can't foreach through a linked list
- You can insert nodes into the center of the list but need to carefully preserve the links. Store the link of the node before insertion, change it to the new node, and give that new node the stored link. If you mess this up the tail end of the linked list just drifts off into memory obscurity.
