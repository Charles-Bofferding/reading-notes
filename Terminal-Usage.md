*Terminal Usage*

A useful cheat sheet of terminal commands can be found [here](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/)

Some important things to remember about operating in the terminal
1. Inputs are case sensitive
2. Spaces in names are not allowed without quotes around the full name
3. Relative paths: defined by the current working directory and the things contained within it. Often started with ~/
4. Absolute paths: defined by a specific location or file in relation to the root file of the overall system. Needs to be defined from drive to relevant folder.
5. You can modify commands run by adding -MODDIFIER on most commands adding specificity and complexity to your prompts.


*Text Editors*

These notes come from the source material [here](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) .

The important items for a text editor are...
1. Code completion: Having the editor help you maintain code syntax and options.
2. Syntax Highlighting: To help maintain a clear structure to your code and maintain workability.
3. Extensions: Everyone loves a good modding community

Because text editors are such a universal tool it is important to remember to be careful with saving files with the correct extension names and locations. One slipped save location or naming a file as .md instead of .txt could crash a project.
