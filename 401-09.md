# *[LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.objectmodel.collection-1?view=net-5.0)*

## Basics ##

- LINQ stands for Language integrated queries and consists of 3 parts
  - Obtain the data source
  - Create the query
  - Execute the query
- The most common data to be reffereenced seems to be an SQL database.
- Also any enumerable data type can be used, these are called local sequences because they are not remote data sets.
- Filters can be chained together to create a more specific search



## The Why of LINQ ##

- Easy syntactical way of searching through databases.
- This seems to have been added on later in the revisions, probably a reaction to a feature I don't know about in another language.
