# *Programming with JavaScript*

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript gives you the ability to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser. 

Best practice says that you should initiialy define a goal, then plan out the process to acheive it, then code each individual step into your script.

Some or all of the steps may be conditional and not run everytime the script is. Use flow chart planning to help identify these.

## What is an Operator?

An operator is used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

A list of javaScript operators can be found [here](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/javascript/pdf_bw/). 

Be careful when using operators on different types of variables because unexpected results can occur.

## What is a Function?

A Funtion lets you group together a series of statements to perform a task. 

Functions accept parameters and return values when called. This can not apply to certain functions. Other functions don't even need names.

To create your own function follow the syntax of function the_name( any required inputs){argument1, argument2}.
