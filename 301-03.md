# *Passing Functions as Props*

**List and Keys**
- What does .map() return?
  - .map() returns an array that is filled with the results of calling a function on each element inside the array that it is being run on.
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  - In order to display array values in JSX you need to wrap each of the elements in map with curly braces, and then plave that entire new array into a DOM render to have it display.
- Each list item needs a unique ____.
  - Key, though only for it's siblings and not lobally unique.
- What is the purpose of a key?
  - Keys are used by React to know what items change, move, get removed, etc. It is an identifier that react will use to target different elements

**The Spread Operator**
- What is the spread operator?
  - the spread operator is three dots that is used to take an iterable object into a list of arguments for some other function.
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
  - Combining objects, adding an item to a list, combining arrays, and converting nodelists to arrays can all be done by the spread operator.
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

````let newArr = [...arr1, ..arr2];````
- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

````let newArr = [...oldArr, newItem]````
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

``let newObj = {...firstObj, ...secondObj}``

**How to Pass Functions between Components**
 - Create the function wherever the state that it will be changed is located
 - Functions can be passed as props to new components
