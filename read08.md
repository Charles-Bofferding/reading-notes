# *Operators and Loops*

## Operators

A list of javaScript operators can be found at the [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) website.

Logical operators allow you to do more than one comparison at a time with things like or (||). and (&&), or not (!) operators. From the reading examples only boolean values are allowed.

## Loops

Loops check a conbdition, and if it is met run a specified bit of code. 

While loops check something and if true will run the code contained within their loop.

Do while loops operate almost exactly like while loops except the will always run their ontained code at least once.

For loops typically have a counter that is incremented or changed by the code within the loop and wait for the counter to reach a specific (or range) of values before the loop is left.
