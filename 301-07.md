**Node**
- Who is Roy Fielding?
  - He helped write the first web servers and created the formative HTTP protocol
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - Because there are many different ways for things to be specified that differ from one database to another, to a server, to someone's personal PC. 
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - A way for computers to specify the location of information anywhere in the world in a way that can be transmitted to any computer in the world. Kind of a way to try and standardize the "Verbs" of computer communication.
- What does a GET do?
  - GET pulls information from a desired location so that it can be interpreted by your machine and read as a representation. 
- What does a POST do?
  - POST sends a request that the server accepts the information contained within and incorporates that into the stored data.
- What does PUT do?
  - PUT is similar to POST but needs more exact information. It can also create new pathways to the desired information.
- What does PATCH do?
  - PATCH modifies and existing resource, while PUSH and POST are giving new information PATCH is the inverse to this.
