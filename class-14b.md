# *What Google Learned About Teams*

**So Google spent A LOT of money to creep on it's employees**


- Google has a creepy department called "People Operations department" that spends millions measuring nearly every aspect of it's employees daily lives.
- They learned people collaborate more, and this isn't because communication has been made leagues easier by technology but because of a change in the workplace, like ease of cmmunication
- They couldn't find any defineable things in the truisms that Boomers use to describe good working conditions, they did find two things though
  - If everyone gets close to equal speaking tie the group is more productive. It is less reliant on a single person as the only point of failure
  - If people have a high social IQ and don't trample on others in their group then the people not getting trampled on contribute more to the group.
- Psychological Safety is the term they created for a group dynamic that was needed for effective teams. Basically do the team members feel like they can raise their voice and be heard without derrision or loss of face.

Sorry if these notes seem tongue in cheek but this seems like a company spent millions of dollars to find out something you should learn in kindergarden.
