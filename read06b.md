# How Computers Work

The 3 most significant reading I got from the videos presented are...

1. All computers must take inputs, store those inputs, process the stored information, and the output that processed information.
2. Computers leverage the binary number system to create exponentially more information storage while only having a *yes* or *no* state. So long as the inputs you are receiving are only digital and don't go into analog systems. Those inputs will need to be processed into binary values in order to be stored
3. The most significant thing about computers that I have come across during my time as an electrical engineer focused on PCB design, and also found in this video, is the vast difference between the time scales that computers operate on vs the human time scale. Computers are basically able to produce magic by running in timeframes of nano seconds, allowing literarily millions of individual computations per second.
