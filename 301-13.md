## Status Codes Based on REST Methods ##

- In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
  - 100’s = Informational status codes that tell you if something didn't quite work and the server is going to be trying to still compute stuff for you.
  - 200’s = Success code, it is doing it's thing.
  - 300’s = A redirect code telling the client to look somewhere else for the resource they requested.
  - 400’s = Client error code, you did sometihng wrong talking to the server.
  - 500’s = Server error code, it has done something wrong and not you.
- What is a status code 202?
  - The request has been accepted but this is probably an asynchronous step so the response will come some time in the future.
- What is a status code 308?
  - Telling the client that "Your princess is in another castle"
- What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
  - 204 No Content code would be used.
- What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
  - 308 Permanent redirect code would be used.
- What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
  - 403 is the forbidden status code.


## Build a REST API ##

- Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
  - To make sure that it is at least somewhat hidden and not easily stolen. Also becuase if it is a local host later it might want to be something else.
- What is middleware?
  - Code that runs when the server gets a request but before it hits your routes.
- What does app.use(express.json()) do?
  - Lets the server accept JSON as the body of the request.
- What does the /:id mean in a route?
  - That this is a parameter that can be seen by the code.
- What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?
  - PUT would update all of the information at once while PATCH can fill in only certain areas being more specific.
- How do you make a defalut value in a schema?
  - Give the field being created a default:X where X is the default value.
- What does a 500 error status code mean?
  - That there has been an internal service error.
- What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
  -200 is more generic and means that everything is OK, while 201 is specific for something being created.


## What I Want to Learn More About ##
- Just like more on the tiny things you need to do to set up a server to talk to clients while not having it explode.
