# *React Component Lifecycle*
- Methods called on functions and components in React are called lifecycle events. 
- They can be put into three categories
  - Mounting: When you are reparing the component and it's state to be added to the application
  - Updating: When a component needs to change state or react to some change.
  -Unmounting: Removing the component and cleaning up any links, dependencies, or DOM tree hanging branches.

**Mounting**
- When an instance of a component is being created and placed in the DOM it happens during mounting. Here are some functions that can occur during this phases.
- Constructor: Can be used to bind events to the instance. It is run before the React Component is mounted. Don't use things like this.setState because it can cause the instance to ignore props passe to the instance
- static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This one is apparently rarely used and should be used when state changes are tied to prop changes.
- Render(): Only required and essential method in a component class. Avoid having it modify the state because you can cause issues there. If the shouldComponentUPdate() returns false the component will not be rendered.
- componentDidMount: Happens immediately after the component mounts. This is the area where things like setting the state, linking to APIs, and handling subscriptions should go.

**Updating**
- shouldComponentUpdate(): When a component undergoes a state change it will typically render itself again. If this function returns false it will not render.
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): Rarely used, it gets you a snapshot of the DOM before the update happens.
- componentDidpPdate(): Used for specifying what to do after an update, often  used in network requests.


**Unmounting**
- componentWillUnmount(): This allows you to specify ways to clean up the DOM or close subscriptions or netwrok requests. 

**UNSAFE**
- Some functions that were previously causing many errors now have the tag UNSAFE_ in front of them. I think it would be a good idea just to not use them, because a standard is a hard thing to change and if that many people agreed they are a bad idea then they really must be.
