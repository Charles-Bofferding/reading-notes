# *Authentification*

## OAuth ##

- What is OAuth?
  - An open-standard authorization protocol th=at tells independant services how to authenticate access to stored info without acutally receiving their login credentials.
- Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
  - When you log on to a website that validates you by linking you to a different website which logs you in then pases that authentification to the original website you were accessing.
- How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?
  - First website connects to the second
  - The second website generates a one time token and unique message unique to this encounter.
  - The second website sends that information over.
  The client processes this information to ensure authentification then transmits authentification back to the first website.
  - The user accepts whatever the transaction is and the second website will then allow it to go through. And the user is alerted to this.
- What is OpenID?
  - OpenID is a similar authentification process, but instead made to have users only need one authentification access area. It was overtaken by Facebook because it has more name recognition and the quthors of this article really wanted to point out how it has been rolled into oAuth and should therefore show how cool their program is.


## What I Want to Learn More About ##
- Every person that talks about authentification makes it sound like they have the ony authentification protocol in the world. How many aer there actually and is there one industry standard monolith like I keep being told?
