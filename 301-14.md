# *Diversity and Inclusion in Tech*

## When women stopped coding ##

- What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
  - Personal computers started being available at home and were marketed to being mostly a male encoded thing. Gender roles were more strict then and while not everyone went with that the majority of the populace did.
- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - Because they had been gaining a famliarity with the basic usage of computers and seeing it as something that they would be doing in their future. If you are only given dolls to play with computers will always seem a bit complex and scary because you are not encouraged to tackly that hill.


## Employee Breakdown ##

- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  - First that the tech industry is more diverse than the US Congress by a large degree. I know the purpose was to look at company data but that last little data point at the end was sad to see.
  - Apart from amazon, apple, and dell if a company has a larger population of a minority it is only one particular category, probably having something to do with where their HQ is located and available population of employees.
  - The Asian ethnicity category is over-represented compared to the other categories listed in a pretty large way.


## Why diversity matters ##

- When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - When the people at the top try and push the change. Having one local manager is nice but for systemic change of a company it has to come from the top.
- Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - Because there is a brittleness in the design of something that only relies on one input. With a diversity of collaborators you can see problems from different angles.
- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - I don't think a user base should ever need to serve a company, a company is there to be used by the people. And an example is something like having a walk in clinic have people who can speak many different languages incase a patient is ESL or does not speak english at all.

## What I Want to Learn More About ##
- What recent efforts have done to improve the tech literacy of the entire population and how efforts in education can bring more people into "tech literacy".
