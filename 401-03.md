# *File Manipulation / System.IO*

## System.IO Namespace ##

- System.IO contains many types that can be used to help manipulate, read, and otherwise intertact with files outside of your program.
  - File, FileInfo, Directory, DirectoryINfo, and Path are all relevant and can be raed more about [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/)
  

## Streams ##

- The abstract base class streams can be used to read data from the stream into a data structure, write information from a datasource to the external, or seeking (changing where you are in the current stream).

## Writing text to a file ##

- StreamWriter can be used either synchronously or asynchronously to write information to a file.
- File provids only static methods to write information to a file, or append that information to a file.
- Path allows you to concatenate strings into a file pathway so that you can target the correct areas.
