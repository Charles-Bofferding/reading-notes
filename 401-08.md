## Basic Types ##

- Collections are interfaces, lists, dictionaries, and base calsses.
- Collections can have many different base interfaces placed on them, such as IEnumerable, IEnumerator, IDisposable, ICollection,. and IList
- LinkedList is a generic doubly lnked list that we will always have access to.
- Queue is another type of data structure adhering to the FIFO process.
- Stack is another type of data structure with a LIFO process, the opposite of how the terminology is used in magic the gathering.
- Enum are ways to define a set of members in an enum that will refference to the first variable and all have integer values. By default the first defined enum value gets 1 and then they increase, but this can be overwritten


## The Why of Collections ##

- These are ways to make "collection" of data that can be expanded and reshaped, unlike Arrays in C#.
- The different standard ays of operating give you more tools to attack problems with than just having Arrays as your only data structure.
