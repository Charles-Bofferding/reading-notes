# *Introduction to HTML and JavaScript*

**HTML Structure**

HTML helps define the backbone structure of your webpage. There are several sections with different purposes. Further attributes can be added into the tags to add further definition or variables.

1. Body: Defines the whole section which will be displayed in the main browser window.
2. Head: Contains onformation about the page, but not displayed in the main page itself
3. Title: Often found in the head, this defines what will appear on the tab at the top of a users internet explorer.
4. Element types: Block elements take up a whole section of the page horizontally. This is good when one item needs to e the focus. Inline elements tr and stack themselves together and can therefore be tiled horizontally.
5. Header/Footer: These elements are shown at the top and bottom of your page respectively.
6. Navigation: Contains the links between different areas on your site.
7. Article: A way to contain major elements of your site that could be stand alone information
8. Figure: Any content that is not part of the main flow of the article. This can be an image, graph, video, etc.
9. Div: A way to group elements together that do not neatly fit into another broad category.

**Site Design**

Make sure that when you are designing your website to keep the suer experience in mind. If you expect the user to visit many times make sure that the path to their desired infomrmation is easy to find and reach. Site maps and wire frames can be used to plan out the website to make sure that you have the entire vision for your website planned out. This includes things like formatting, styling, size, color, and other ways of creating grouping or seperation of elemnts.

**JavaScript**

Scripts are ways to create a list of steps of code that can be run to acheive certain tasks. It is important to remember that a computer will always do exactly what you tell it to, not more or less. If your code is running into problems it is often helpful to look for assumptions taht you have made that the computer might not be intuitively doing because as said above it only does the exact steps it was told to.

Object: An object is something for the code to hold in memory and display on your site. 

Event: This is defined as a any interaction that can be used as a indicator for your code to perform a function. This can be triggered by the user, a different part of your code, or even just the site loading up.

Method: Perform a task with the current status of your site loaded into the browser. In this way it can work with user inputs.
