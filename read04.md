# *Structuring Webpages with HTML*

## Know your audience
* When designing a website make sure to consider your audience, who might be visiting your webpage?
* What is the objective of the audience visiting your site and whatinformation will they need?
* How often do you expect users of your website to visit?

## Essential Design Elements
* Setting a structure or *site map* of your webpage can help organize it.

* A *wireframe* is a basic mock up of the layout of an individual page, setting up the spacing for headers and the like.

* Try to incoporate a *Visual Hierarchy* where the largest and most visible items are top level information for your users.

* Ensure that the *Grouping* of various elements on your webpage help guide the user to the information they need.

* *Navigation Bars* should be both simple to read, and un-clutured in design to ensure that there isn't a messy or confused presentation.

## HTML Specific Design Elements
* Body: The element containing all other parts of your webpage.
* Header and Footers: items that will show up on the top and bottom of every page.
* Navigation: Contains the main navigation elements of the webpage
* Articles: elements that contain a section of the page that could stand alone
* Asides: Used in an article it is an item that is related to the article but not directly related. If it is used outside of an article element it should be something relevant to all the other elements on the home page.
* Figures: Refference images, make sure to caption and source them.
