# *HTML Image, Color, and Text*

**Images**

- Images can be added to your website. It is important to control their size through height and width variables. These can be set to percents of the page, absolute sizes, and I am sure other ways too.
- The align attribute can be used to tell other elements how to interact with the image.
- Make sure to not add in images of to high quality or the wrong format, this will load slower on your webpage and should be avoided.
- The transparency of an image can be moddified to let content behind shine through or to set the image as a background.

**Image Type Usage**
- JPEG: For pictures without any singular dominant color that has a lot of detail in it.
- PNG: For things that will need to be transparent or only have one dominant color because it compresses the information down better.
- GIF: Use this when there is an animation.

**Color**
- Color can be set with hex codes, RGB values, or a set of 147 color names. 
- They can also be set be set through the properties of hue, saturation, and brightness. 
- Opacity can be set for colors changing the visibility of elements behind the colored item.

**Text**
- There a great many types of text fonts. My biggest takeaway from this chapter is that the computer interpretting the webpage must also know what font you are calling or it is all for not.
- Typefaces are also subject to copywrights apparently so really use something that is a standard default for professional purposes.
- Font familys can be used to set a few different options for font so the interpretting computer can run through a few options if it doesn't know one of the fonts.
- Font sizes can be defined in pixels, in percents of the page, or in ems (an em is the width of a letter m says the book, that doesn't exactly make sense for me, why that specific letter?).
- @font-face can be used to try and force a computer to use a font that is not installed by giving it a path to the desired font.
- [This](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/) is a cheat sheet for CSS that has a section on font properties. Look at it if you are wondering how to moddify something in particular.
