# *Unit Testing and Documentation*

## Unit Testing ##

- What is unit testing?
  - A way to isolate and test a specific unit of your code.
  - In a non-circular way of defining unit testing there is a unit testing project type in VS that you can use to define inputs and expected outputs from other bits of code.
  - Make sure that each test is only targeting one small feature, if you test an output that relies on two different feature you are not going to be able to know which specific bit failed.

## XUnit Documentation ##

- This link gave me a 404 error, the link needs to be updated or my computer doesn;t like this specific github page.

## README files ##

- In a world where modular bits of code can be taken from the web and added into projects documentation of what the code is and does is very important.
- They should always contain a name, one-liner description, usage details, API interactions constraints, installation instructions, and the license used for the component.
- In general use technical writing best practices, be breif, don't use flowery language, all the usual stuff.
