# *Classes & Memory Management*

## [Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes) ##

- A class is a refference type. This means that at runtime it is started empty until youu declare that it has specific values or instantiate it with a new declaration.
- Classes support full inheritance from other objects, as long as they do not have the "sealed"definition.
  - A class can only inherit from one other class, but because you can daisy chain them together you can get around this.

## [Constructors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors) ##

- Constructors are called whenever a class or struct is created.
- If you do not declare a constructor for a class or struct c# will do it for you, using standard default values for any variables asa best it can.
- Instance constructors create an object.
- Static constructors are parameterless and used to initialize static members of the same type.

## [Properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties) ##

- Properties enable a class to expose ways of getting or setting values without exposing the entire implementation of those values. Get reads the vbalues, set inputs values, and init is used during the creation of the class to intialize valuse.
- If the property return is only one line you can ften is the "=>" expression definition to write it in a single line of code.
- Properties can be auto implemented, this should involve declaring a get and set for the property and then the compiler will create the backing field for you.

## [Garbage Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals) ##

- In a managed langage garbage collection is much easier than in languages which are "lower level". This means that there is an automatic process that handles clearing memory when it is no longer being used.
- Memory allocation is done automaticlly which means you do not need to consider searching for a space large enough to store the data that you are looking for.
- Each managed process is given a "heap" of memory that is it's own personal memory space. 
- For writing efficient code it is important to be aware of the limitations of the computers you are running on. If the value in will work then use that instead of a larger 64 bit memory type and such things.
