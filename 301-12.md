## NoSQL vs SQL ##

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relational Database | Distributed database|
| Table Based Database   | Key-value pair database |
| Predefined data structure schema   | Dynamic schema for unstructured data | 	 
| Vertically Scalable   | Horizontally Scallable |	 
| Emphasizes ACID properties   | Follows Brewers CAP Theorem |

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  - When you need complex queries in an intensive environment.
- Give a real world example.
  - Requesting information from Facebook on a user's info.
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  - When the data is less complex but speed is important.
- Give a real world example.
  - The New York Times website uses it.
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL Databases
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  - SQL can increase scalability on one server while NoSQL needs more servers added to handle scalability.

## SQL vs NoSQL ##

- What does SQL stand for?
  - Strucutred Query Language.
- What is a realational database?
  - A database that accepts the structured query language and lets you operate in a defined schema. There can be several tables with defined schemas, some tables just being links between other tables.
- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  - There are records (rows in the table) that get placed in the database which need specific and defined information in them.
- What is a ‘schema’?
  - A defined way to say each record only has these information fields and new ones can't easily be added on.
- What is a NoSQL database?
  - There are collections that have documents inside them. But the documents can have different schemas.
- Howo does it work?
  - There are collections that have documents in them. Each document is akey value pair.
- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  - Collections and documents
- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  - MongoDB is more flexible because you don't need to commit to a signle schema and can have each document be more variable.
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  - There are no relations, you need to hard code them


## What I Want to Learn More About ##
- Which of these data structures is more prevalent in the world in which applications.
- How have the databases changed over time to meet the requirements of the real world applications that they are being implemented in?
