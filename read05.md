# *CSS and Color*

## CSS
* CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
* CSS is declared in curly brackets with property and value pairs inside.
* Using different selctors you can target design rules for specific portions of the webpage you are creating
* Link elements in HTML can be used to refference a CSS rule set
* CSS can be declared inside an HTML page by using the style element

## Color

Color can be specified in 3 ways
* Hex codes: Three double digit hex values written with no seperation between them will define the color displayed
* RGB Values: Three numbers from 0 - 255 define the color displayed. Each number is tied to the amount of red, green, or blue that will be mixed to create the final color.
* Color Names: There are a limited number of pre-delared color names available to coders

### Additional Color Moddifiers

* Opactiy can be added with the rgba command where the fourth number would be the opacity (or see-through-ness) of the element also defined.

* Another moddifier that can be used is hsl, or hsla. That stands for...
* Hue: an idealized representation of color defined as a degree of rotation on the color wheel

* Saturation: A percentage defining the amount of gray in a color

* Lightness: The amount of white or black in the color. defined as a percentage with 0% being only white and 100% being only black
* Alpha: A fancier way of saying opacity, it is defined as a value between 0 and 1.0 with 0.75 meaning 75% transparency
