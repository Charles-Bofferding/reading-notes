# *CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations*

**[Transforms (w3 link for syntax)](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp)**
- Transforms are ways to move, reshape, or otherwise alter objects in 2D or 3D ways on your page.
- Use the transform prefix in CSS, additional modifiers for the specific browser that you are trying to work with may be needed
- Look through the w3 link at the top to see the different transform operations available to you.
- Different transform commands can be added to the same CSS transform line
- Transform origins can be chosen, remember that the origin is refering to a point on the object and not the container.
- You can make a star wars style scroll by messing with perspective.

**[Transitions (w3 link for syntax)](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition.asp)**
- Transitions allow you to change an element when a state change occurs
- Transitions can be multiple key frames to give a more fluid animation look.
- Use w3 for full syntax but it should have 2 CSS declarations, one with the element and the second the element:trigger
- Transstional properties are things that can be moved between in different states. Many different options can be controlled as well as things like the time it takes to make those transitions. Look at the w3 link for an exhaustive list.

**[Animations (w3 link for syntax)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)**
- Animations are  ways to have an element move on a page
- They can be repeated any number of times and have other such properties to specifiy. Check the w3 link for an exhaustive list.
- Is it just me or does the 6 buttons animated page only have [3](https://codepen.io/retyui/pen/ByoaXV).
